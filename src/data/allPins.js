Food is  produced as water flows through vegetation and land. Vihiga county is  in Western Kenya with  some parts having rocky and hilly terrain, as well as there being numerous streams along the valleys. There is high population density and continuous appetite for land. This has destroyed most of the natural vegetation especially around catchment/watershed areas. They have gained much inspiration from existing models such as that of Julius Astiva, a farmer  who has an excellent living example of interconnections on the land, as well as using all  harvested water.</p><p>The presentation includes the example of Julius and will also show how other farmers are following suit by protecting catchment areas and becoming examples of whole farm systems, as learning examples for the rest of the community.</p>",
