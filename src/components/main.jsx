        The overall goal of this Pan African Water School is to stimulate
        community interaction and action to improve an understanding of, and
        boost capacity in sustainable local, community based water resource
        management across Africa.{" "}

            and communities across the world.

      <p>
        In countries across the world, small communities are doing pioneering
        work in creating and securing local water sources and reversing the
        adverse impacts of too much water (floods) or too little water
        (droughts). This Water Schools web portal presents their successful
        methods of water retention interventions through their own presentations
        and videos of their successful methods.
