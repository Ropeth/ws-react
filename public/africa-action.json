          "intro": "<p>Mazvihwa is one of the most arid areas in South Central Zimbabwe. The area has all typical characters of a marginalized community. The area receives very scanty and unpredictable rainfall averaging 400ml annually. Poor farming methods, increasing population and deforestation lead to regular river and dam siltation. Rivers and dams due to siltation and scanty rainfall quickly dries up leaving people and livestock struggling to get water for drinking and other purposes. Dam rescooping will increase the water holding capacity of dams; extend the duration in which dams can store water. This will curb the increasing death of livestock during drought years and give people water for domestic, horticulture and analogue forestry uses during the dry season. A well scooped dam might also support the community through provision of fish.</p>",

As a result there is food insecurity and limited access to water.</p>",
